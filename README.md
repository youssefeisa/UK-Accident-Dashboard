# 🚦 UK Road Accidents Dashboard  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **interactive dashboard** that visualizes UK road accidents and casualties data.  
The dashboard provides insights into accident trends, casualty distribution, and risk factors based on official accident datasets.  

It helps policymakers, analysts, and researchers **understand accident patterns** and identify the main contributors to road incidents (vehicle type, road type, light conditions, etc.).
